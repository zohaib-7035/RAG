    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will work with [Weaviate API](https://weaviate.io/) to build a tiny RAG system. You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load a [collection](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/collections) for BBC News data.\n",
    "- Use the Weaviate API to retrieve documents from the vector database.\n",
    "- Create functions to retrieve data based on Semantic Search, BM25 and Hybrid Search (using RRF) using the Weaviate API.\n",
    "- Use an LLM to generate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: This assignment assumes you know how to handle simple tasks with collections in the Weaviate API. If you are not familiar with it yet, please read the Ungraded Lab on the Weaviate API! Furthermore, the data you will be working here is already *chunked*. You can get more hands-on experience on chunking reading the Ungraded Lab on chunking!"

      "The relationship between the United States and Brazil in 2024 has been shaped by various factors, including economic, political, and cultural ties. Here's an overview of the key aspects of their relationship:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Economic Ties:** Brazil is one of the largest economies in Latin America, and the US has a significant interest in the country due to its strategic location and natural resources. The two countries have a long-standing trade relationship, with the US being one of Brazil's largest trading partners. In 2024, the US-Brazil trade relationship has been strengthened, with both countries working to increase trade and investment in areas such as agriculture, energy, and infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Brazil's Growing Influence in the Global Arena:** Brazil has been increasingly asserting its influence on the global stage, particularly through its membership in the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) grouping. This has led to a growing relationship between Brazil and other emerging economies, including the US. However, this has also raised concerns about Brazil's alignment with other countries, such as China, which has led to tensions with the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "**US Concerns about Brazil's Stance on Ukraine:** The US has been critical of Brazil's refusal to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, which has led to tensions between the two countries. The US has expressed concerns that Brazil's stance on Ukraine could undermine its efforts to promote democracy and human rights in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cultural and People-to-People Ties:** Despite the tensions, there are also strong cultural and people-to-people ties between the US and Brazil. The two countries have a long history of cultural exchange, with many Brazilians studying in the US and vice versa. In 2024, there have been several high-profile visits between US and Brazilian leaders, including a visit by US President Joe Biden to Brazil in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reparations for Slavery:** The issue of reparations for slavery has been a contentious topic in Brazil, with some states apologizing for their role in the transatlantic slave trade. The US has also grappled with this issue, with some states apologizing for their role in the slave trade. In 2024, there have been calls for Brazil to provide reparations to African descendants in the country.\n",
