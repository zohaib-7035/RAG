    "Chunking plays an important role in information retrieval. For example, when building a vector database from a collection of books, different chunk sizes can serve different purposes. Cataloging entire books as single vectors may help in identifying broad themes, but misses specific details. Chunking closer to the paragraph or sentence level enables the retrieval of specific information or concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models typically have limitations on the amount of text they can process at once, known as the \"context window.\" Chunking helps ensure that text inputs remain within these boundaries, allowing models to handle large documents, like novels, by splitting them into smaller sections.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Evolution and Maturity (2008-2010s)**: Over the years, Git has evolved to become a powerful version control system. It has added features such as submodules, gitk, and git bisect, making it easier to use and more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Open-Source and Community Involvement**: Git has become an open-source project, with a large community of contributors and users. This has led to the development of various tools and extensions, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.\n",

      "2. **Development of Git**: In 2005, Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, began developing a new tool based on some of the lessons learned while using BitKeeper. The goals of the new system were to be fast, simple, and fully distributed.\n",
      "3. **Maturity and evolution**: Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain its initial qualities. It has become a popular version control system used by many projects, including Linux.\n",
